## Recap 

Inheritance 
Encapsulation
? 



Polymorphism? 

## final 

variable 
it becomes constant 


class 
it cannot be overriden 

method 
can not override



## Problem 

Class Employee 
1. calculateSalary()
salary, hourlySalary, noOfHoursWorked, hourlyRate


FullTimeEmployee,       PartTimeEmployee,      Contractor
calculateSalary()       calculateSalary()      calculateSalary()

Vehicle is a Car     - IS-A   car extends Vehicle 
Macbook is a Computer  - IS-A
Iphone is a Mobile  - IS-A 


Has-A relationship 
Java has Syntax
Car has Steering 
Employee Has address  , X  Employee is a address 


## Abstraction ? 
Data hiding 
-- showing only essential details 
car - 
what is does rather than how it does.
