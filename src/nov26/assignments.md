## Java 8 Assignment

1. Write a program that uses the Predicate functional interface to filter a list of integers. Remove all integers greater than 50 from the list and print the resulting list.

2. Create a program that uses the Function functional interface to convert a list of String values to their respective lengths. For example, if the input list is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the output should be [5, 6, 6].

3. Write a program that uses the Consumer functional interface to print each element of a list with its index. For example, given the list ["Java", "Python", "C++"], the output should be:

4. Implement a Supplier that generates random integers between 1 and 100. Write a program to print 5 random integers using this Supplier.

5. Write a program using the BiFunction functional interface to concatenate two strings with a space in between. For example, given the inputs "Hello" and "World", the output should be "Hello World".

6. Write a program that uses the Predicate interface to filter a list of integers based on multiple conditions. For example, remove all integers that are:
Less than 10.
Greater than 30.
Odd numbers.
Print the resulting list.
